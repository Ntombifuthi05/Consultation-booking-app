# 📅 Consultation Booking App (Flutter + Firebase)

## 📌 Application Overview

This project is a consultation booking app
The application integrates **Firebase Authentication** and **Cloud Firestore** to provide secure login and real-time data storage. It supports full consultation management, student profiles, and a complete admin panel.

The app is built using **Flutter** and follows the **MVVM (Model–View–ViewModel)** architecture to ensure clean separation of concerns, scalability, and easy maintenance.

There are two main user roles:
- **Students** – manage their consultations and profiles
- **Admins** – manage and monitor all consultation bookings

All features are implemented according to the assignment requirements and design guidelines.
